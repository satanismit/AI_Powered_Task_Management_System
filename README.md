# 🤖 AI-Powered Task Management System

A smart task management solution that leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to automatically **classify, prioritize**, and **assign tasks** based on user behavior, deadlines, and workloads.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Design and develop an intelligent task management system that uses **NLP** and **ML techniques** to:
- Classify tasks based on content.
- Predict priority levels of tasks.
- Assign tasks intelligently based on:
  - User workload
  - Behavior scores
  - Deadlines
